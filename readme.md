# Object Oriented Programming Supervisions

This is a repository of all of my code for the OOP supervisions in Michaelmas term 2022

## Structure
There is a separate project per supervision.
Each question is a separate class in the project. Sometimes classes are used for multiple questions, and are labelled as such
(e.g. Class file containing Questions 3 and 4 is called Question34.java)
The Main.java file contains some tests/demonstrations of functionality for each question

## SupoRun Library
I am using a custom libary to pretty-print some tests and demonstrations.
All of the calls to this library are in the Main.java file. They are pretty self explanatory, but are not used in the actual questions themselves, only for tests/demonstrations.
