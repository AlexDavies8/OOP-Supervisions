# Object Oriented Programming Supervisions

This is a repository of all of my code for the OOP supervisions in Michaelmas term 2022

### SupoRun
I am using a custom libary to pretty-print some tests and demonstrations.
All of the calls to this library are in the Main.java file. They are all fairly self explanatory, but the actual code for the supervisions is in separate files per question.
